## Folder Collections Media and Public Folder

By default the CMS stores media files for all collections under a global`media_folder`directory as specified in the configuration.

When using the global`media_folder`directory any entry field that points to a media file will use the absolute path to the published file as designated by the`public_folder`configuration.
